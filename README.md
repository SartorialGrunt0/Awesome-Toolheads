# Awesome-Toolheads

The FDM 3D printer toolhead is the heart of the material extrusion process. It is responsible for extruding, heating, depositing, and cooling the filament. 

This is a list of publically available toolhead designs which can built using a combination of 3D printed parts as well as an extruder, hotend, fans, LEDs, and PCBs. There are so many different options available for a huge variety of printers. The list will focus solely on community made toolheads for Voron and Printers for Ants.
