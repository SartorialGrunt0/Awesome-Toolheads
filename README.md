# Awesome-Toolheads

The FDM 3D printer toolhead is the heart of the material extrusion process. It is responsible for extruding, heating, depositing, and cooling the filament. 

This is a list of publically available toolead designs which can built using a combination of 3D printed parts as well as an extruder, hotend, fans, LEDs, and PCBs. There are so many different options available for a huge variety of printers. The list will focus solely on community made toolheads for Voron and Printers for Ants.

Looking for an extruder to go with your toolhead of choice? Check out [Awesome-Extruders](https://github.com/SartorialGrunt0/Awesome-Extruders/).
